# typosquatting-detector-proxy
A DNS Proxy with (limited) typosquatting detection

# Assumptions

1. It should be possible to use typosquatting-detector in the proxy
2. It should be possible to define how "bad website page" looks like
3. Installation should be as easy as possible
4. It should have limited features (only few stable dependencies) in order to:
  - make good code review 
  - make it secure
5. It should be easy to check if it's running and alive
